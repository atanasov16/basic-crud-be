<h1>Basic Crud Application</h1>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>JDK (Recommended: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/" target="_blank">OracleJDK</a>) - 17 or above</li>
  <li>Maven</li>
  <li>IDE of choice (VSCode, Intellij, Eclipse..)</li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a> - to generate requests (will not be needed when front-end is developed)</li>
</ul>
This is a simple project that uses controllers to create/change information about locations and departments.
The applicaton contains 2 entities: Location and Department. Each department has many locations; one location has only one department.
For early testing, its best to use Postman with a JSON body when generating requests, since the controller uses request parameters as method arguments and the front-end of the application is still in works.
Enjoy!
