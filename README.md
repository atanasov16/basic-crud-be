This is a simple project that uses controllers to create/change information about locations and departments.
The applicaton contains 2 entities: Location and Department. Each department has many locations; one location has only one department.
For early testing, its best to use Postman with a JSON body when generating requests, since the controller uses request parameters as method arguments and the front-end of the application is still in works.
Enjoy!
