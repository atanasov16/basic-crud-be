In order to open and run the project, one would need to have installed Java18 (or above).
This is a simple project that uses controllers to create/change information about locations and departments.
The applicaton contains 2 entities: Location and Department. Each department has many locations; one location has only one department.
For early testing, its best to use Postman with a JSON body, since the controller uses request parameters as method arguments.
Enjoy!
